Must do:
* support recursive benchmarks, including dependencies
* make benchinit respect some high-level flags like -failfast

Perhaps do:
* check that packages have no BenchmarkInit already (but would the error be much
  better than now?)
* make -benchmem a default argument
* do a single 'go test -bench' invocation overall, not one per package (should
  fix the -failfast issue above?)
